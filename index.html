					As a child, I was so determined to design a website that was better than any of the free templates available at the time. While most kids spent their vacations riding bikes and playing video games, I spent the summer before 6th grade pouring over HTML and CSS tutorials. Coding logic came naturally for me; running my code and seeing it work was so incredibly satisfying that I wanted to keep learning more.

					As an adult, my love for coding remains the same. I am a fast learner, operating on the notion that the only way to get better at coding is, quite simply, to keep coding. I'd like to think that I approach learning the same way that I did when I was 11: wide-eyed, curious, and ready to keep trying new things in order to learn what does and does not work. I still find running working code to be just as satisfying as I did when I was first learning.
					</p>

					Outside of the web development world, I can usually be found with knitting needles in hand or my head in a book. My random talents include making an awesome lasagna, reading astoundingly fast (so I am told,) and meticulously planning future vacations. Seriously, go ahead and ask me about my Google Maps vacation planning technique. I'd like to think it's pretty cool.
